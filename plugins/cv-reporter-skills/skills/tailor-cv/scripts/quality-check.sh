# Quality checks for the tailor-cv skill (issue #104, ADR-0028).
#
# Runs the backend's cvcheck CLI (backend/cmd/cvcheck) — the same Go check
# code the web app's Generate/Render path calls — so a skill-run Generation
# gets the same groundedness, ATS-parsability, page-count and language
# checks an app-run one does. Everything it runs is offline: no backend
# container, no API key, no network.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, like the typst compile it sits next to):
#   scripts/quality-check.sh groundedness --selection output/<slug>/selection.json [--json]
#   scripts/quality-check.sh pdf --pdf output/<slug>/cv.pdf --data output/<slug>/data.json [--json]
#
# Exit status is cvcheck's: 0 = ran, nothing flagged; 1 = ran, something
# flagged; 2 = the check could not run. The skill treats none of them as
# fatal. The binary is built from this checkout's backend/ source on each
# call (Go's build cache keeps that fast), so it can never be stale relative
# to the backend; if `go` isn't available, a prebuilt `cvcheck` on PATH is
# used instead, and if neither exists this prints a "check unavailable"
# note and exits 2 rather than failing the pipeline.
